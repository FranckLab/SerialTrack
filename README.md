# SerialTrack MATLAB code package

### SerialTrack: ScalE and Rotation Invariant Augmented Lagrangian Particle Tracking    

This repository contains the Matlab m-files to run our SerialTrack particle tracking algorithm. This code package includes both 2D and 3D particle tracking scripts for full-field 2D and 3D displacement fields, respectively. More details can be found in our SerialTrack paper (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352711022001224).

## Install and execute SerialTrack

### Code installation

To run SerialTrack, please download MATLAB version later than 2021a and install these code packages/toolboxes:
* Curve fitting toolbox
* Image processing toolbox
* Parallel computing toolbox
* Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
* Wavelets analysis toolbox


### Input Image Requirements

* 2D image sequences (at least two frames)
* 3D volumetric images (at least two volumetric stacks)

Images should have segment-able and localizable particles: limited or no particle clusters, particles distinguishable from noise, roughly spherically/cylindrically symmetric, size (roughly) 3 px to 20 px diameter. See examples of particles in the test cases. Custom pre-processing, segmentation, and localization codes can be straightforwardly incorporated (and are encouraged for challenging imaging or specimen conditions).

### Running included example case

1. Make sure that the main files and the supplemental m files (from file exchange) are added to the path in Matlab.
2. Download and save the [example data sets] in the "./imgFolder" folder. 
3. Run the example*.m files in the folder "./Example_main_files"
    1. Edit the paths for SerialTrack and images (as needed)
    2. Check for lines labeled "TODO" and follow instructions (as needed)
